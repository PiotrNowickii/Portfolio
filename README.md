# Peter Nowicki's portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio, in this repository you can find information about the projects that I was part of so far.
# 1. Oil City
A 2D strategy game, made for the "Dialogue of Civilizations: Poland in Pixels" project, where students from PJAIT (Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw) and NU (Northeastern University in Boston) worked together to make games promoting Polish culture. The game was developed under the guidance of mentors from various game development companies, including 11 Bit Studios, Techland, and Bloober Team.

# 3. Space Detour
A 2D RPG with survival mechanics. The player character crash lands on an alien planet and has to gather resources, complete quests and explore to rebuild their ship and escape. The game was made in a 4 person team (3 programmers, 1 artist). Due to the fact that the game was made for my engineering thesis at PJAIT (Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology), I cannot currently publish it anywhere for people to test. However, I should be able to do so, after the end of the next semester.

It was my first game that I've worked on so there might be things that I would have currently done differently.

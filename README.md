# Piotr Nowicki's portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio, in this repository you can find projects that I've worked on in the past.
# 1. A quest for a jar of dirt
A simple platformer created in a team of four, for our game development class 8-week project. Almost all of the assets used came from the [Treasure Hunters](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/treasure-hunters) asset pack created by Pixel Frog.
It was my first game that I've worked on so there might be things that I would have currently done differently. 
Parts of the game I was responsible for:
* Collapsing and dropdown platforms
* Collectibles (health and strength potions, coins, diamonds, keys)
* Coin and key counter
* Locked and unlocked chests
* Shooting totems
* Water and boat platforms
* Enemy scripts (chase, patrol, attack)
* The design of the 2nd level

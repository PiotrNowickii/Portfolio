# Piotr Nowicki's portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio,in this repository you can find projects that I've worked on in the past.
# 1. A quest for a jar of dirt
A simple platformer created in a team of four, for our game development class 8-week project. Almost all of the assets used came from the [Treasure Hunters](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/treasure-hunters) asset pack created by Pixel Frog. It was my first game that I've worked on so there might be things that I would have currently done differently. 
Parts of the game I was responsible for:
-collapsing and dropdown platforms
-collectibles (health and strength potions, coins, diamonds, keys)
-Coin and key counter
-Locked and unlocked chests
-Shooting totems
-water and boats
-Enemy scripts (chase, patrol, attack)
-the design of the 2nd level
